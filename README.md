# LoRa Home Automation

Home automation is evolving with the integration of IoT and long-range wireless communication technologies. **LoRa (Long Range)** technology offers a solution by enabling low-power, long-distance communication, making it ideal for smart home applications in large areas or remote locations.

This project demonstrates a modular home automation system using LoRa modules and microcontrollers to wirelessly control appliancesâ€”even across floors, gardens, or distant rooms.


## Features

-  Long-range wireless control using LoRa SX1278
-  Relay-based switching for lights, fans, or other appliances
-  Secure command transmission with device ID filtering
-  Optional Blynk integration for mobile dashboard
-  Expandable architecture for multi-node setups



## Hardware Used

- Arduino Uno / Nano
- LoRa SX1278 modules
- Relay module (1/2/4 channel)
- ESP8266 (optional for Blynk)
- Power supply (5V regulated)
